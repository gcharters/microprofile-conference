= MicroProfile Showcase Application

== General information

The application consists of several Microservices and a Web-Application managing a conference :

* `microservice-schedule` : Schedule of the conference
* `microservice-session` : Sessions of the conference
* `microservice-speaker` : Speakers of the conference
* `microservice-vote` : Votes for each session
* `web-application` : Frontend Angular2 | Bootstrap4

The WebApp is a direct subscriber to the individual Microservices.
This means that there is no aggregator / middle-man application.
The WebApp itself provides a known relative EndPoint microservice that enables the lookup of
URLs to the other services.

The sample is a version of the MicroProfile sample application, designed to run all the services on Open Liberty.

mvn clean package -P start
----

To view the Web application, open a browser at http://localhost:8080/

To build each service but not start the individual servers:

----

== Common problems/bugs

=== NPM issues

The web-application project uses the *com.github.eirslett:frontend-maven-plugin* to download
and install all node and npm requirements.
Sometimes this may fail if console permissions are not permissive enough.

In such cases you will have to manually install some reqiurements:

<1> Download and install node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/

<2> Install npm manually:

----
cd web-application/src/main/static
npm install npm
npm install typings --global
typings install --global
----
